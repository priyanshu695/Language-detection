I wish to introduce you to an amazing project, the Language Detection model using Natural Language Processing. 
We are using the Language Detection dataset, which contains text details for 17 different languages.

Introduction

Every Machine Learning enthusiast has a dream of building/working on a cool project, isn’t it? Mere understandings of the theory aren’t enough, you need to work on projects, try to deploy them, and learn from them. Moreover, working on specific domains like NLP gives you wide opportunities and problem statements to explore. Through this article, I wish to introduce you to an amazing project, the Language Detection model using Natural Language Processing. This will take you through a real-world example of ML(application to say). So, let’s not wait anymore.

 
About the dataset

We are using the Language Detection dataset, which contains text details for 17 different languages.
Languages are:
* English
* Portuguese
* French
* Greek
* Dutch
* Spanish
* Japanese
* Russian
* Danish
* Italian
* Turkish
* Swedish
* Arabic
* Malayalam
* Hindi
* Tamil
* Telugu
Using the text we have to create a model which will be able to predict the given language. This is a solution for many artificial intelligence applications and computational linguists. These kinds of prediction systems are widely used in electronic devices such as mobiles, laptops, etc for machine translation, and also on robots. It helps in tracking and identifying multilingual documents too.
